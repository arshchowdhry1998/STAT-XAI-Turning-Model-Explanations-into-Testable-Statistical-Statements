# STAT-XAI-Turning-Model-Explanations-into-Testable-Statistical-Statements
Artificial-intelligence systems are increasingly used in settings where decisions must be explained. Most popular explainers rely on heuristics and provide no statistical guarantees, leaving users unsure which features truly matter. We introduce STAT-XAI, a model-agnostic framework that turns explanations into testable statistical statements: : each featureâ€™s association with model predictions is assessed on held-out data using hypothesis tests with multiple-testing control and standardized effect sizes. Across controlled synthetic datasets with known ground truth and multiple real-world benchmarks, STAT-XAI yields stable, parsimonious rankings that filter spurious correlates and run orders of magnitude faster than SHAP baselines. By coupling effect size with significance and uncertainty, STAT-XAI makes explanations clear, compact, and reliable for practitioners in finance, healthcare, and beyond.
